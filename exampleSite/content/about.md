Hello there, I am Kavithvajen, people usually call me Kavith. I hold a degree in M.Sc. Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin and I’m currently working as a software developer.

I have always been passionate about computers, software programming and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something I’ve always been a fan of. Recently, I have been obsessed with how important it is for technology to be used in an ethically right way. Security of systems, user privacy and ethical use of data are the areas that excite me the most. My master’s dissertation was aimed at building a tool to ensure ethical data integration. The tool helps data integrators make informed decisions about the various ethical issues that might arise after the datasets have been integrated.
Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
* https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma
* https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop
* https://github.com/spf13/cobra
* https://github.com/spf13/viper

Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.

Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.

Websites built with Hugo are extremely fast, secure and can be deployed anywhere including, AWS, GitHub Pages, Heroku, Netlify and any other hosting provider.
