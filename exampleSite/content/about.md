Hello there, I am Rahul, people usually call me Kavith. I hold a degree in M.Sc. Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin and I’m currently working as a software developer.

I have always been passionate about computers, software programming and technology as a whole. The thrill of building something I envisioned in my mind and watching it work is something I’ve always been a fan of. Recently, I have been obsessed with how important it is for technology to be used in an ethically right way. Security of systems, user privacy and ethical use of data are the areas that excite me the most. My master’s dissertation was aimed at building a tool to ensure ethical data integration. The tool helps data integrators make informed decisions about the various ethical issues that might arise after the datasets have been integrated.

This website is supposed to be a portfolio for all my work and will be updated as I progress in my career.

- Rahul.
